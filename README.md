# Market-Link — Frontend

> **Nigeria's Verified B2B Trade & Investment Intelligence Platform**
> WebCortex Technologies Limited · Frontend Application

## Overview

Market-Link is a verified B2B trade and investment intelligence platform for the Nigerian market. This repository contains the frontend web application — a Next.js 16 app that provides the user interface for registration, onboarding, marketplace browsing, listings, messaging, AI features, and administration.

The frontend communicates exclusively with the backend REST API. All business logic, data validation, and tier enforcement happen on the backend — the frontend is responsible for presentation, form handling, and user experience.

4. **Verification badge is always prominent** — never hidden or small
