## How to Use This Document

Before starting a sprint's API integration work:
1. Find your current sprint below
2. Check each **success metric** against the backend
3. Run the **verification test** to confirm readiness
4. If any metric fails, mark it as 🔴 and build with **mocked data** (see Mocking Guide at bottom)
5. Log the blocker in your `TRACKER.md`

## Sprint 1 — No Backend Dependencies

Frontend Sprint 1 is fully independent. Focus on project setup, design system, and shared components.

**Backend readiness required:** None.

---

## Sprint 2 — Authentication Endpoints

### What Frontend Needs

The frontend auth pages (Register, OTP, Login) require these backend endpoints to be functional.

### Success Metrics

| # | Metric | How to Verify | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| SM-2.1 | Backend server starts and responds on configured port | `curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health` returns `{ "success": true }` | 🔲 |
| SM-2.2 | Register endpoint creates user and sends OTP email | Send `POST /auth/register` with valid data → 201 response + OTP email received | 🔲 |
| SM-2.3 | OTP verification issues JWT | Send `POST /auth/verify-otp` with correct OTP → response contains `accessToken` and `refreshToken` | 🔲 |
| SM-2.4 | Login returns JWT with user status | Send `POST /auth/login` → response contains `accessToken`, `verificationStatus`, `tier` | 🔲 |
| SM-2.5 | JWT is valid for protected routes | Send `GET /users/me/status` with Bearer token → 200 with user data | 🔲 |
| SM-2.6 | Invalid credentials return proper error | Wrong password → `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED" } }` | 🔲 |
| SM-2.7 | Validation errors return field-level detail | Missing email → `{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "field": "email" } }` | 🔲 |
| SM-2.8 | Token refresh works | Send `POST /auth/refresh` with valid refresh token → new access token | 🔲 |

### Verification Script

```bash
# Quick verification sequence — run from terminal
API=http://localhost:5000/api/v1

# 1. Health check
curl -s $API/health | jq .success
# Expected: true

# 2. Register
curl -s -X POST $API/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","phoneNumber":"+2348012345678","password":"Test1234!"}' | jq .

# 3. Verify OTP (use OTP from email/console)
curl -s -X POST $API/auth/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"<userId>","otpCode":"<otp>"}' | jq .

# 4. Login
curl -s -X POST $API/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Test1234!"}' | jq .
```

## Mocking Guide

When a backend endpoint is not yet ready, the frontend should build against mocked responses. This approach avoids blocking frontend progress while maintaining correct data shapes.

### Mock Strategy

1. Create a `lib/mocks/` directory
2. Each mock file exports functions matching the API client interface
3. Use environment variable to toggle: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`
4. All mock data must match the **exact** response shape from `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`

### Example Mock Structure

```
lib/mocks/
├── auth.mock.ts          # Mock register, login, OTP responses
├── listings.mock.ts      # Mock listing data
├── messages.mock.ts      # Mock thread/message data
└── index.ts              # Mock toggle logic
```

### Rules
- Mock data must use realistic Nigerian business names, states, and commodities
- Mock IDs must be valid UUIDs
- Mock dates must be within realistic ranges
- Remove mocks before production — `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` must never be `true` in production
